                <h2>Products and Services:</h2>

                <p>For over 40 years, Accurate Anodizing, Inc. has specialized in Bulk Anodizing of aluminum parts, especially fasteners. Sometimes known as "Barrel Anodizing", Bulk Anodizing allows large numbers of parts to be Anodized as one lot, allowing significant price savings with little to no sacrifice in quality for the right type of parts. While Bulk Anodizing is not suited for flat parts, or parts with large flat surfaces, small parts without many straight lines - such as rivets, screws, or aluminum rings - are ideally suited to the process and result in a fantastic coating at a fraction of the cost of conventional Rack Anodizing. Racking of parts is available upon request for those parts not suited to the Bulk process.</p>

                <p>Accurate Anodizing, Inc. provides Anodized coatings certified to MIL-PRF-8625 (superseding MIL-A-8625) Type II Class 1 and 2, we can Seal the parts in your choice of Hot Water, Nickel Acetate, Sodium Dichromate, along with offering a Duplex Seal. We regularly stock up to 15 different colors including Black, Gold, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Brown, Grey, Violet, and Turquoise along with a variable selection of others.</p>

                <p>Along with the Anodize coatings, Accurate Anodizing, Inc. also provides Chemical Conversion Coatings (Chem-Film/Chromate/Irradite/Alodine) certified to MIL-DTL-5541 (superseding MIL-C-5541), Stainless Steel Passivation (AMS 2700 & ASTM A967), and Titanium (in accordance with Hi-Shear 306 & ISO 8080).
                </p>

                <p>Accurate Anodizing, Inc. has maintained either an ISO 9001 or QS 9000 certification for over two decades, and we are currently certified to ISO 9001:2015.</p>
